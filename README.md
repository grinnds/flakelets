# flakelets ❄️

A collection of flake templates.

This repository is a collection of flake templates I use to bootstrap dev
shells. They reflect my preferences and workflows and may change at any time.

If they’re useful to you, feel free to copy or adapt them.

## Usage

Create a new flake from a template:

```bash
nix flake init -t github:grinnds/flakelets#<template>
```
